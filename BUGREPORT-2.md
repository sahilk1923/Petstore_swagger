# Testing Overview

## Tested Endpoints:
**User**: Create User, Get user by user name, Update user by user name, delete user by user name, user login and user logout
***Note: Tested using JSON format ***
**Pet**: Adding a new pet to the store, find pet by ID, updating an existing pet and delete pet by petID
***Note: Tested using XML format***


## Key Focus Areas:
- API key authentication
- OAuth2 authentication
- User session validation
- Status code validation (e.g., 200, 400, 404, 500)
- Response body validation
- Invalid inputs, incorrect formats, and edge case scenarios

## Potential Areas for Additional Testing:
- Test the remaining endpoints for functionality
- Testing with null or empty values in the request body
- Specifying different content types (e.g., application/json, application/xml)
- Testing with different Accept headers to validate response formats

# Create user - This can only be done by the logged in user.

**Bug**: Creat user endpoint, allow creation of a user with the same user request body multiple times intead of returning an error
- **Ticket ID**: BR-001
- **Severity**: Major
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Create a user with a specific credentials. e.g.
  ```json
  {
    "id": 54,
    "username": "john4kbvih4jvs",
    "firstName": "john4kbvih4jvs",
    "lastName": "john4kbvih4jvs",
    "email": "johnreb109eabrqJia",
    "password": "john4kbvih4jvs",
    "phone": "1111111111",
    "userStatus": 0
  }
  ```
  2. Repeat the request with the same user credentials
  3. Observe the response 
- **Expected Result**: The Create User endpoint should enforce uniqueness for user accounts. When attempting to create a user with existing credentials, it should return an appropriate error response (e.g., 409 Conflict) indicating that the user already exists. 
- **Actual Result**: The user is created successfully without any errors and returning 200 status code. Allowing duplicate users can cause data inconsistency.

---

**Bug**: Creat user endpoint, exhibits inconsistent behavior in ID assignment.
- **Ticket ID**: BR-002
- **Severity**: Major
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Attempt to create a user with id = 0 or a negative number and observe the response.
  2. Create a user with a valid id value greater than 0 amd observe the response
- **Expected Result**: The system should return an error when an ID of 0 or a negative number is provided. Users should only be created with a valid, positive ID. 
- **Actual Result**: The system assigns a large number when the ID is 0 or negative, and IDs greater than 0 are assigned as expected, leading to inconsistent ID assignment. It can lead to data integrity issues.

**Bug**: Creat user endpoint, currently allows the creation of a new user without requiring authentication, which poses a significant security risk.
- **Ticket ID**: BR-003
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Priority**: High
- **Steps to Reproduce**:
  1. Attempt to create a new user without being logged in.
  2. Observe the response.
- **Expected Result**: The system should require user authentication and return a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden status when an unauthenticated request is made.
- **Actual Result**: The user is created successfully without any authentication required and rreturns 200 status code. Allowing unauthenticated user creation is a severe security flaw,

      "lastName": "johnvovva39embs",
      "email": "johnvovva39embs@gmail.com",
      "password": "johnvovva39embs",
      "phone": "1111111111",
      "userStatus": "23"
  }
  ```
  2. Observe the response.
- **Expected Result**: The API should validate input types and return an error message when incorrect data types are provided
- **Actual Result**: The API accepts the incorrect data types returns 200 status code  without validation and automatically converts them into their correct types , which can lead to data integrity issues and unexpected behavior in the application. Incorrect type handling is a severe issue that could lead to unpredictable behavior.

--------------------------------------------------

# Assumptions
1. The server generates the user `id` automatically if it's not provided or set to `0`. This is considered standard behavior for server-side ID generation.
2. assumption for the new user is that every user needs to have unique username as we have usernam get user by username and update user by username 
3. There are parameters which are marked with * are required and other fields can be missed or left blank or don't need to put in the request body or header

3. Data type validation issues exist, such as allowing integers for string fields (e.g., `username`, `firstName`) and strings for integer fields (e.g., `id`).
4. Missing fields in the request body do not cause validation errors.
